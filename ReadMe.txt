Hello Mr/Ms TA. I put all of my files (pics, css, html, etc) in 1 folder because there were some 
issues with the referencing in other folders. Not sure what it was about, but this is what I have! 

I also ended up doing in-line CSS rather than a new sheet because I was having issues referencing my
popper and JS/Jquery and Bootstrap but I originally thought it was an issue with my CSS page - hence I 
got rid of it. 

Hope it works ok!
